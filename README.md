Lina-Speech is a neural codec language model that provides state-of-the-art performances on zero-shot TTS. It replaces self-attention with [Gated Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06635), we believe it is a sound choice for audio.
It features: 
- **Voice cloning** with short samples by prompt continuation.
- **High-throughput** : batch inference can go high at no cost on a consumer grade GPU.
- **Initial-State Tuning** (s/o [RWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) + fast implem by [FLA](https://github.com/sustcsonglin/flash-linear-attention)): fast speaker adaptation by tuning a recurrent state. Save your context window from long prompt !

### Checkpoints
#### WavTokenizer
You will need this checkpoint of WavTokenizer **and the config file** : [[WavTokenizer-ckpt]](https://huggingface.co/novateur/WavTokenizer-medium-speech-75token/blob/main/wavtokenizer_medium_speech_320_24k.ckpt) [[config file]](https://huggingface.co/novateur/WavTokenizer-medium-speech-75token/resolve/main/wavtokenizer_mediumdata_frame75_3s_nq1_code4096_dim512_kmeans200_attn.yaml)

#### Lina-Speech
Dataset: LibriTTS + LibriTTS-R + MLS-english split (10k hours) + GigaSpeech XL:

169M parameters version trained for 100B tokens: [[Lina-Speech 169M]](https://huggingface.co/lina-speech/all-models/tree/main/lina_gla_gigaspeech_d1024l12_convblind_shortconv_lr2e-4
)

### Inference

### Disclaimer

Before using these pre-trained models, you agree to inform the listeners that the speech samples are synthesized by the pre-trained models, unless you have the permission to use the voice you synthesize. That is, you agree to only use voices whose speakers grant the permission to have their voice cloned, either directly or by license before making synthesized voices public, or you have to publicly announce that these voices are synthesized if you do not have the permission to use these voices.
